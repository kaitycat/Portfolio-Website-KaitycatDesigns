        <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/211154424">The Procession of Shame</a> by <a href="https://vimeo.com/user63508882">Charlie Watson</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
          <p>This short film was a group project Directed by Charles Watson that I edited and helped collect audio for, it was done this year (2017) for an assignment.
          The premise for this short film was to re-create a scene from a famous film as closely as possible, we used "What We Do In The Shadows" for inspiration.</p>

        <p><a href="https://vimeo.com/213000194">3.6 Final</a> by <a href="https://vimeo.com/user63508954">Caitlyn Manderson</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
          <p>This short film was the first video I ever really edited and is possibly my favourite of all my videos, it was made for an assessment in 2016 and is the main reason I wanted to continue editing further.</p>

          <p>This video was made for the band MERRIN for a USB version of their music they wanted to sell.
            They asked me to take footage and edit it for them and also gave me permission to use the video as part of my portfolio.
            I suggest checking out their music online at: <a href="http://www.merrinmadness.com/">http://www.merrinmadness.com/</a></p>

          <p>This video is just a funny video I edited one day for a friend.</p>
